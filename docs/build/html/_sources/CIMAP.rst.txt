Algorithm functions
-------------------

This section contains all the functions that are used to perform CIMAP with the description of the expected inputs and outputs. 
Here are presented all the functions that are given to apply the algorithm to a dataset. There are two possile way to apply the algorithm:

1. The function **run_algorithm** that automatically runs all the functions requesting the user to select the input file where the data is stored.
2. Use the other functions sequentially as explained in the :doc:`CIMAP Application Example <../example>` section, where is shown the sequential application of the functions for obtaining the results of CIMAP application.
